        "content": "## Basic principles The PostFinance Ltd remuneration scheme meets the \"Minimum standards for remuneration schemes of financial institutions\" defined by FINMA (Circular 2010/1) and the Ordinance on Execu- tive Pay issued by the Federal Council. ## Remuneration policy Board of Directors The amount of the fees paid to members of the Board of Directors is based on their function and the demands placed upon them. Expenses are reimbursed. The chairing of committees and any ex- traordinary efforts conducted outside the range of normal Board activities are remunerated addi- tionally. Remuneration of the Board of Directors is determined by the General Meeting. Executive Board Corporate risk, scope of responsibility and the Confederation's Ordinance on Executive Pay are tak- en into account by the Board of Directors when setting the remuneration due to members of the Executive Board. ## Remuneration structure Remuneration for members of the Executive Board is comprised of a fixed annual base salary and a performance-related variable salary component. This may be a maximum of 16.6 percent of the gross annual base salary and is paid annually. It is determined on the basis of benchmarks for Swiss Post Ltd (50 percent) and PostFinance Ltd (50 percent). The personal performance of members of the Executive Board is not taken directly into account. At Swiss Post Ltd level, the variable component is calculated on the basis of operating income, the EBIT effect from efficiency measures, Group EBIT and the return on capital employed (RoCE) (each weighted at 12.5%). At PostFinance Ltd level, re- turn on equity (RoE) (weighting: 75%) and the result from non-interest-sensitive business (weighting: 25%) are used to calculate the variable component. In the determination of overall target achieve- ment, additional qualitative supplementary values (so-called modulators) are taken into account, with consideration given to the aspects of human resources, customers, society and the public, and ecological sustainability. Depending on the assessment of the qualitative supplementary values by the Board of Directors, target achievement at Group and PostFinance levels can be marked up or marked down for each modulator. Both mark-ups and mark-downs can amount to a maximum of 7.5 percent for each modulator. In all cases, however, overall target achievement can be a maximum of 100 percent. Members of the Executive Board receive a first-class GA Travelcard, a company car if necessary (pri- vate use is invoiced), a mobile phone and a monthly expense account. Individual bonuses may be paid to reward special personal contributions. Neither the members of the Executive Board nor persons closely linked to them received any addi- tional fees, remuneration, guarantees, advances, credits, loans or benefits in kind during the financial year. Both the base salary and the performance component are insured for members of the Execu- tive Board: occupational pension provision is handled by the Swiss Post pension fund in accordance with the basic plan and supplementary plan 1 for salary components up to twelve times the maxi- mum Swiss Old Age and Survivors' Insurance (OASI) retirement pension (344,160 francs in 2021). Any income in excess of this amount is covered by an external comprehensive insurance solution. Contributions to occupational pension provision are divided in line with the regulatory provisions applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund. Employment contracts are based on the Swiss Code of Obligations. Severance payments can be paid in justified cases up to a maximum of half the gross annual salary. The notice period for members of the Executive Board is six months. ## The Board of Direc- tors determines the remuneration for the Executive Board. <!-- PageNumber=\"18\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ### Consideration of risk A penalty system also applies for the calculation of the variable salary component of members of the Executive Board. Both performance levels are taken into account (Swiss Post Ltd and PostFinance Ltd) to determine whether the threshold for the variable component has been reached. The variable component is paid only on reaching this value. There is a penalty area below the threshold for the variable salary. If a penalty applies, the variable salary component is reduced accordingly. ### Remuneration in 2021 #### Human resources PostFinance Ltd paid a total of 379 million francs in salaries to its staff in 2021. This sum consists of fixed salaries of 352 million francs and variable components of 27 million francs, which were pre- dominantly for 2020 and paid in 2021.

The notice period for members of the Executive Board is six months. ## The Board of Direc- tors determines the remuneration for the Executive Board. <!-- PageNumber=\"18\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ### Consideration of risk A penalty system also applies for the calculation of the variable salary component of members of the Executive Board. Both performance levels are taken into account (Swiss Post Ltd and PostFinance Ltd) to determine whether the threshold for the variable component has been reached. The variable component is paid only on reaching this value. There is a penalty area below the threshold for the variable salary. If a penalty applies, the variable salary component is reduced accordingly. ### Remuneration in 2021 #### Human resources PostFinance Ltd paid a total of 379 million francs in salaries to its staff in 2021. This sum consists of fixed salaries of 352 million francs and variable components of 27 million francs, which were pre- dominantly for 2020 and paid in 2021. Remuneration of 15 million francs for 2021 will not be paid until the subsequent year. PostFinance employed 3,633 staff on average in 2021. This corresponds to 3,237 full-time equiva- lents. #### Board of Directors The Members of the Board of Directors (including the Chairman) received remuneration of 829,600 francs (fees and fringe benefits). The fringe benefits amounted to 55,800 francs. The Chairman of the Board's fee totalled 200,000 francs, and fringe benefits amounted to 20,000 francs. Remuneration for members of the Board of Directors who also hold an Executive Management position at Swiss Post is paid directly to Swiss Post Group. The upper fee limit of 835,300 francs in total, which was determined by the General Meeting, was respected. ##### Executive Board The Members of the Executive Board (including the CEO) received base salaries of 2,823,391 francs. The fringe benefits amounted to 158,621 francs. The variable remuneration payable to members of the Executive Board, which is based on the average attainment of targets in the previous two years, amounted to 481,935 francs. The CEO's base salary amounted to 683,962 francs. The variable remuneration amounted to 113,538 francs. The upper limit of 4,956,318 francs for the total remuneration amount for the Executive Board (in- cluding employee benefits), which was determined by the General Meeting, was respected. <!-- PageNumber=\"19\" --> Foreword Interview \\- Corporate governance Management report Statutory annual financial statements\n=== PostFinance Ltd | Remuneration CHF 2020 2021 Chairman of the Board of Directors Fees 200,000 200,000 Fringe benefits Expenses and representation allowances 20,000 20,000 First-class GA travelcard 2 6,300 0 Total remuneration 226,300 220,000 Other members of the Board of Directors (6)1 Fees Base remuneration 360,000 360,000 Remuneration from committees 218,000 213,800 Fringe benefits Expenses and representation allowances 14,700 13,800 Additional fringe benefits 3 2,500 22,000 Total remuneration 595,200 609,600 Entire Board of Directors (7)1 Fees 728,000 773,800 Fringe benefits 93,500 55,800 Total remuneration 821,500 829,600 CEO Fixed base salary 6 550,000 683,962 Variable remuneration 6 Variable salary component (paid out the following year) 233,646 113,538 Fringe benefits Expenses and representation allowances 19,200 19,200 Additional fringe benefits 4 15,646 15,346 Total remuneration 818,492 832,046 Other members of the Executive Board (6) Fixed base salary 6 2,404,458 2,139,429 Variable remuneration 6 Variable salary component (paid out the following year) 782,204 368,397 Additional payments 5 677 8,374 Fringe benefits Expenses and representation allowances 118,750 87,500 Additional fringe benefits 4 52,013 36,575 Total remuneration 3,358,102 2,640,275 All members of the Executive Board (7) Fixed base salary and variable remuneration 3,970,985 3,313,700 Fringe benefits 205,609 158,621 Total remuneration 4,176,594 3,472,321 1 Remuneration for members of the Board of Directors who also hold an Executive Management position at Swiss Post is paid directly to Swiss Post Group. 2 In the year in which the Chairmanship of the Board of Directors was handed over, neither the previous nor the new Chair of the Board of Directors claimed a GA Travelcard. 3 The higher additional benefits result from special expenses for the recruitment of the new Chair of the Board of Directors and a new Member of the Executive Board 4 Other fringe benefits include: first-class GA Travelcard, company car and mobile phone. 5 Beat Jaccottet, Head of Business Development, left the Executive Board in 2021.

        "content": "## Basic principles The PostFinance Ltd remuneration scheme meets the \"Minimum standards for remuneration schemes of financial institutions\" defined by FINMA (Circular 2010/1) and the Ordinance on Execu- tive Pay issued by the Federal Council. ## Remuneration policy Board of Directors The amount of the fees paid to members of the Board of Directors is based on their function and the demands placed upon them. Expenses are reimbursed. The chairing of committees and any ex- traordinary efforts conducted outside the range of normal Board activities are remunerated addi- tionally. Remuneration of the Board of Directors is determined by the General Meeting. Executive Board Corporate risk, scope of responsibility and the Confederation's Ordinance on Executive Pay are tak- en into account by the Board of Directors when setting the remuneration due to members of the Executive Board. ## Remuneration structure Remuneration for members of the Executive Board is comprised of a fixed annual base salary and a performance-related variable salary component. This may be a maximum of 16.6 percent of the gross annual base salary and is paid annually. It is determined on the basis of benchmarks for Swiss Post Ltd (50 percent) and PostFinance Ltd (50 percent). The personal performance of members of the Executive Board is not taken directly into account. At Swiss Post Ltd level, the variable component is calculated on the basis of operating income, the EBIT effect from efficiency measures, Group EBIT and the return on capital employed (RoCE) (each weighted at 12.5%). At PostFinance Ltd level, re- turn on equity (RoE) (weighting: 75%) and the result from non-interest-sensitive business (weighting: 25%) are used to calculate the variable component. In the determination of overall target achieve- ment, additional qualitative supplementary values (so-called modulators) are taken into account, with consideration given to the aspects of human resources, customers, society and the public, and ecological sustainability. Depending on the assessment of the qualitative supplementary values by the Board of Directors, target achievement at Group and PostFinance levels can be marked up or marked down for each modulator. Both mark-ups and mark-downs can amount to a maximum of 7.5 percent for each modulator. In all cases, however, overall target achievement can be a maximum of 100 percent. Members of the Executive Board receive a first-class GA Travelcard, a company car if necessary (pri- vate use is invoiced), a mobile phone and a monthly expense account. Individual bonuses may be paid to reward special personal contributions. Neither the members of the Executive Board nor persons closely linked to them received any addi- tional fees, remuneration, guarantees, advances, credits, loans or benefits in kind during the financial year. Both the base salary and the performance component are insured for members of the Execu- tive Board: occupational pension provision is handled by the Swiss Post pension fund in accordance with the basic plan and supplementary plan 1 for salary components up to twelve times the maxi- mum Swiss Old Age and Survivors' Insurance (OASI) retirement pension (344,160 francs in 2021). Any income in excess of this amount is covered by an external comprehensive insurance solution. Contributions to occupational pension provision are divided in line with the regulatory provisions applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund. Employment contracts are based on the Swiss Code of Obligations. Severance payments can be paid in justified cases up to a maximum of half the gross annual salary. The notice period for members of the Executive Board is six months. ## The Board of Direc- tors determines the remuneration for the Executive Board. <!-- PageNumber=\"18\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ### Consideration of risk A penalty system also applies for the calculation of the variable salary component of members of the Executive Board.

PostFinance issues annual financial statements in the statutory form in accordance with the account- ing rules under banking law (articles 25-28 of the Banking Ordinance, the FINMA Accounting Ordi- nance and FINMA Circular 2020/1 \"Accounting - banks\"). In the past, the management report was primarily based on key figures as per Group IFRS guidelines. The goodwill capitalized as part of the conversion to a private limited company in 2013 was completely impaired at the end of the 2019 financial year. Consequently, there has no longer been any amortization of goodwill since 2020. Accordingly, the delta between the income statements under IFRS and under ARB has undergone a significant decline. The management report has therefore essentially been converted to ARB data. The other external publications of PostFinance Ltd on the capital adequacy statements are also based on ARB data. The internal, dual reporting based on IFRS and ARB consolidated accounting standards is not affected by the conversion in the management report. In the \"Profit situation\" section and in the consolidated Group Financial Report, a table reconciles operating profit (EBIT), financial services segment under Group IFRS guidelines with PostFinance Ltd profit in accordance with ARB. ### Markets PostFinance believes in the power of entrepreneurial freedom. That's why it serves its markets in four independent business areas: as the leading Swiss financial institution, PostFinance is driving forward the digital transformation in payment transactions and retail banking. It is also creating in- novative solutions in digital first banking and expanding its range of services in the platform business with Valuu. While doing so, it is constantly focusing on the requirements of its customers - individuals and com- panies throughout Switzerland. ## Customers PostFinance is one of Switzerland's leading financial institutions. It offers products and services that appeal to everyone. Its approximately 2.6 million customers often come into contact with PostFi- nance: whether when making payments in e-finance, via the app or at the checkout, during a con- sultation at one of its branches about financing, investment or retirement planning, when looking for the ideal mortgage with Valuu or trading cryptocurrencies via the new Yuh app. <!-- PageNumber=\"23\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

PostFinance issues annual financial statements in the statutory form in accordance with the account- ing rules under banking law (articles 25-28 of the Banking Ordinance, the FINMA Accounting Ordi- nance and FINMA Circular 2020/1 \"Accounting - banks\"). In the past, the management report was primarily based on key figures as per Group IFRS guidelines. The goodwill capitalized as part of the conversion to a private limited company in 2013 was completely impaired at the end of the 2019 financial year. Consequently, there has no longer been any amortization of goodwill since 2020. Accordingly, the delta between the income statements under IFRS and under ARB has undergone a significant decline. The management report has therefore essentially been converted to ARB data. The other external publications of PostFinance Ltd on the capital adequacy statements are also based on ARB data. The internal, dual reporting based on IFRS and ARB consolidated accounting standards is not affected by the conversion in the management report. In the \"Profit situation\" section and in the consolidated Group Financial Report, a table reconciles operating profit (EBIT), financial services segment under Group IFRS guidelines with PostFinance Ltd profit in accordance with ARB. ### Markets PostFinance believes in the power of entrepreneurial freedom. That's why it serves its markets in four independent business areas: as the leading Swiss financial institution, PostFinance is driving forward the digital transformation in payment transactions and retail banking. It is also creating in- novative solutions in digital first banking and expanding its range of services in the platform business with Valuu. While doing so, it is constantly focusing on the requirements of its customers - individuals and com- panies throughout Switzerland. ## Customers PostFinance is one of Switzerland's leading financial institutions. It offers products and services that appeal to everyone. Its approximately 2.6 million customers often come into contact with PostFi- nance: whether when making payments in e-finance, via the app or at the checkout, during a con- sultation at one of its branches about financing, investment or retirement planning, when looking for the ideal mortgage with Valuu or trading cryptocurrencies via the new Yuh app. <!-- PageNumber=\"23\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Legal framework PostFinance is a private limited company under private law wholly owned by Swiss Post Ltd. The fi- nancial institution was granted a banking licence as a bank and securities firm on 26 June 2013 and is subject to regulation by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Postal legisla- tion and the strategic goals of the Federal Council and Swiss Post are relevant to PostFinance's busi- ness activities. In particular, postal legislation specifies that PostFinance must provide a universal service for payment transactions throughout Switzerland. It also states that PostFinance may not issue loans and mortgages to third parties 1. PostFinance has been one of Switzerland's five system- ically important banks since summer 2015. This highlights the importance of PostFinance for the Swiss financial system. However, as a systemically important bank, PostFinance must also meet ad- ditional regulatory requirements. ## Developments Customers As a result of technological progress, customers increasingly have access to better networks, so are more well informed. The sheer volume of information available makes things more complex for in- dividuals. There is a demand for simple solutions that offer security and comfort, and hence a positive customer experience. This allows PostFinance to give its customers genuine added value. Competition PostFinance operates in a dynamic market environment with ever greater competition. The ongoing digitization of banking services has resulted in more and more global technology companies, as well as fintech startups, forcing their way onto the market. PostFinance has therefore focused its strategy even more strongly on the digital world. ## Economy The coronavirus pandemic is continuing to have a strong adverse effect on the economy. Against this difficult backdrop, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is maintaining its expansionary monetary pol- icy with a view to stabilizing economic activity and price developments. Interest on sight deposits held at the SNB remains at -0.75 percent. The SNB reaffirms that it will remain active in the foreign exchange market as necessary, while taking the overall exchange rate situation into consideration. The SNB's expansionary monetary policy provides favourable financing conditions, counters upward pressure on the Swiss franc, and contributes an appropriate supply of credit and liquidity to the economy. In the current situation, the inflation outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. This is primarily due to higher import prices, above all for oil products and for goods affected by global supply bot- tlenecks. The coronavirus pandemic is continuing to shape the global economic situation. The eco- nomic recovery worldwide has weakened somewhat since autumn 2021 due to waves of infection in certain areas and supply bottlenecks in various industries in the manufacturing sector. At the same time, inflation was unusually high in both the US and the euro area. In addition to supply chain prob- lems, higher energy prices also played an important role in this respect. In its baseline scenario for the global economy, the SNB assumes that extensive containment measures will not have to be in- troduced again, this despite the adverse developments regarding the pandemic at present. The economic recovery should thus continue, albeit somewhat subdued. Supply bottlenecks are likely <!-- Footnote=\"1 Current efforts to partially revise the Postal Services Organization Act envisage among other things allowing PostFinance to offer loans and mortgages.\" --> <!-- PageNumber=\"24\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> to persist for some time yet, leading to price increases for the goods concerned. In Switzerland, the economic recovery has continued. There was a further robust increase in gross domestic product (GDP), thus lifting it above its pre-crisis level for the first time. The situation on the labour market also continued to improve. ### Regulation Regulatory requirements in the banking sector continue to increase. Due to developments in the European Union and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in par- ticular, new regulatory provisions are either being applied directly in Switzerland or giving rise to an equivalent Swiss solution. Increasing regulation can be seen in particular with regard to due diligence obligations in the area of money laundering prevention, data protection and liquidity and capital requirements. All in all, costs are higher, which is likely to have a substantial impact on margins. <!-- PageNumber=\"25\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs.

As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective. The following table reconciles the financial ser- vices market segment result with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with Group IFRS guidelines and PostFinance Ltd's profit as per \"Accounting - banks\". <!-- PageNumber=\"32\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Reconciliation of profit CHF million 20202 2021 Operating result (EBIT) PostFinance, normalized before fees and net cost compensation 162 272 Normalization 1 \u2013 9 PostFinance segment operating profit (EBIT) as per IFRS before fees and net cost compensation 162 281 Management / licence fees / net cost compensation -30 -11 PostFinance segment operating profit (EBIT) as per IFRS after fees and net cost compensation 132 270 Net income from associates -2 -3 Net financial income -36 -36 PostFinance segment earnings before tax (EBT) 94 231 Income tax 11 -36 PostFinance segment profit 105 195 Consolidation effects from associates \u2013 4 PostFinance Ltd profit before reconciliation 105 199 Valuation differences for financial assets 26 9 Reversal of impairment/impairment on financial assets and receivables, incl. taxes 0 0 Realized gains from (earlier than scheduled) repayments -34 2 Valuation differences between IAS 19 and Swiss GAAP ARR 16 51 -12 Valuation differences, IFRS 16 Leases 0 0 Depreciation of revalued real estate -4 -3 Individual value adjustment due to lower market value (fixed assets) -3 -4 Valuation differences for participations -3 -2 Realized gains from participations 0 -2 Adjustment of deferred tax effects arising from IFRS -9 36 PostFinance Ltd profit as per Accounting - banks 129 223 1 By annulling the regulation on issuing staff vouchers to retirees from 2022, PostFinance had to release to income provisions from other long-term employee benefits. Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective. The following table reconciles the financial ser- vices market segment result with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with Group IFRS guidelines and PostFinance Ltd's profit as per \"Accounting - banks\". <!-- PageNumber=\"32\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Reconciliation of profit CHF million 20202 2021 Operating result (EBIT) PostFinance, normalized before fees and net cost compensation 162 272 Normalization 1 \u2013 9 PostFinance segment operating profit (EBIT) as per IFRS before fees and net cost compensation 162 281 Management / licence fees / net cost compensation -30 -11 PostFinance segment operating profit (EBIT) as per IFRS after fees and net cost compensation 132 270 Net income from associates -2 -3 Net financial income -36 -36 PostFinance segment earnings before tax (EBT) 94 231 Income tax 11 -36 PostFinance segment profit 105 195 Consolidation effects from associates \u2013 4 PostFinance Ltd profit before reconciliation 105 199 Valuation differences for financial assets 26 9 Reversal of impairment/impairment on financial assets and receivables, incl. taxes 0 0 Realized gains from (earlier than scheduled) repayments -34 2 Valuation differences between IAS 19 and Swiss GAAP ARR 16 51 -12 Valuation differences, IFRS 16 Leases 0 0 Depreciation of revalued real estate -4 -3 Individual value adjustment due to lower market value (fixed assets) -3 -4 Valuation differences for participations -3 -2 Realized gains from participations 0 -2 Adjustment of deferred tax effects arising from IFRS -9 36 PostFinance Ltd profit as per Accounting - banks 129 223 1 By annulling the regulation on issuing staff vouchers to retirees from 2022, PostFinance had to release to income provisions from other long-term employee benefits. Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective.

Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs."

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation.

For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\".

Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "value": "PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market.

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021.

An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "value": "Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses."

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year.

Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021.

An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward.

An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective.

Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective.

Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment.

Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective. The following table reconciles the financial ser- vices market segment result with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with Group IFRS guidelines and PostFinance Ltd's profit as per \"Accounting - banks\". <!-- PageNumber=\"32\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Reconciliation of profit CHF million 20202 2021 Operating result (EBIT) PostFinance, normalized before fees and net cost compensation 162 272 Normalization 1 \u2013 9 PostFinance segment operating profit (EBIT) as per IFRS before fees and net cost compensation 162 281 Management / licence fees / net cost compensation -30 -11 PostFinance segment operating profit (EBIT) as per IFRS after fees and net cost compensation 132 270 Net income from associates -2 -3 Net financial income -36 -36 PostFinance segment earnings before tax (EBT) 94 231 Income tax 11 -36 PostFinance segment profit 105 195 Consolidation effects from associates \u2013 4 PostFinance Ltd profit before reconciliation 105 199 Valuation differences for financial assets 26 9 Reversal of impairment/impairment on financial assets and receivables, incl. taxes 0 0 Realized gains from (earlier than scheduled) repayments -34 2 Valuation differences between IAS 19 and Swiss GAAP ARR 16 51 -12 Valuation differences, IFRS 16 Leases 0 0 Depreciation of revalued real estate -4 -3 Individual value adjustment due to lower market value (fixed assets) -3 -4 Valuation differences for participations -3 -2 Realized gains from participations 0 -2 Adjustment of deferred tax effects arising from IFRS -9 36 PostFinance Ltd profit as per Accounting - banks 129 223 1 By annulling the regulation on issuing staff vouchers to retirees from 2022, PostFinance had to release to income provisions from other long-term employee benefits. Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective.

Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective.

Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\".

Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective.

Due to the amended regulation and without normalization, a comparison with the prior-year result would be limited. 2 For purposes of comparability, the changes in pension benefit obligations resulting from the realignment in the Group structure as of 1 January 2021 were also restated accordingly in 2020. <!-- PageNumber=\"33\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Foreword Interview Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## E-finance and TWINT have been well received. An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\".

An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

        "content": "Key figures PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The market-related decline in net interest income in its core business was more than offset thanks to greater activity in the interbank money market, customer asset fees and reversals of impairment on bonds. The result from commission business and services also rose thanks to the expansion of investment services, revenue from e-trading and credit cards and the newly introduced banking package fees for private customers. Trading portfolio assets performed positively as well. However, the coronavirus pandemic also weighed on the result in the 2021 financial year. Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Higher personnel expenses due to changes in the contributions to employee benefits schemes were offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of lower project costs and effi- ciency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. The increase in earnings before tax is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 per- cent and the cost-income ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. The sales and transaction figures confirm the emphasis placed on customers who manage their own finances and use the simple, attractive products offered by PostFinance. The limits of its business model have forced PostFinance to reduce the exemption limits for custom- er asset fees several times. As expected, these measures resulted in an outflow of customer deposits and in some cases in a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. Customer assets de- creased by 13 billion francs year-on-year. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts, and in some cases to a transfer of customer deposits into pay- ment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of customer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. Total assets rose by 4.5 billion francs year-on-year as a result of greater activities in the interbank money market. <!-- PageNumber=\"28\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> PostFinance Ltd \\| Key figures 2021 with previous year for comparison 2020 2021 Balance sheet Total assets as per ARB CHF million 117,189 121,667 Capital ratio as per guidelines for systemically important banks % 19.1 20.3 Going concern leverage ratio 1 % 7.34 4.71 Gone concern leverage ratio % 0.28 0.42 Income statement as per Accounting - banks Operating income CHF million 1,192 1,311 Operating result CHF million 132 223 Profit/loss CHF million 129 223 Return on equity2 % 2.2 3.7 Cost-income ratio % 81.2 75.7 Customer assets and loans Customer assets 3 CHF million monthly avg. 123,679 110,715 Funds, securities and life insurance 3 CHF million monthly avg. 14,490 18,219 Customer deposits CHF million monthly avg. 109,189 92,495 Development of customer assets 4 CHF million 4,019 - 12,965 Managed assets as per provisions of Circ. 2020/13 CHF million 43,642 38,389 Inflow of new money as managed assets 4 CHF million -3,074 -6,890 Loans to business customers (taken up) CHF million 10,498 10,499 Mortgages5 CHF million 6,039 6,262 Market and employee key figures Customers In thousands 2,685 2,576 Private customers In thousands 2,410 2,308 Business customers (incl. banks and agencies) In thousands 275 268 E-finance users In thousands 1,860 1,928 Accounts - private customers In thousands 3,932 3,732 Accounts - business customers In thousands 354 305 Customer satisfaction - private customers Index 81 80 Customer satisfaction - business customers Index 78 77 Average headcount Full-time equivalents 3,260 3,237 Employee satisfaction Index 79 77 Transactions Payment transactions In millions 1,191 1,265 1 In 2020, central bank deposits were able to be temporarily excluded from the calculation of the leverage ratio in accordance with FINMA Guidance 02/2020 on COVID-19. 2 Return on equity = operating result as per ARB/average eligible equity capital as per ARB. 3 PostFinance reports customer assets and managed assets. \"Customer assets\" includes all assets held by customers based on average monthly assets. \"Managed assets\" encompasses only values deposited for investment purposes on the reference date. 4 The managed assets key figure is based on the regulatory requirements in terms of composition and calculation. Customer assets are broader and also include assets that were not deposited for investment purposes (such as private account assets). Moreover, holdings are calculated based on monthly average values. This may result in differing trends between the key figures mentioned. 5 Commission business in cooperation with financial partners. <!-- PageNumber=\"29\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ## Assets and financial situation In the year under review, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased activity in the interbank money market. Growth in customer assets amounted to-13 billion francs in the 2021 financial year. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. In the second half of the year, the ex- emption limits for private and business customer credit balances were therefore adjusted individu- ally. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. PostFinance continues to invest a large proportion of its assets in long-term fixed-interest financial investments in Switzerland and abroad. A very large amount of liquidity was still held at the SNB as at 31 December 2021. PostFinance provides services in the commission business such as funds, e-trading, life insurance and credit cards in cooperation with partners. Average customer assets in investment products rose by 26 percent year-on-year to over 18 billion francs. In addition to an in- crease in e-trading assets, the four new digital investment solutions (e-asset management, fund consulting basic, investment consulting plus and fund self-service) are also being widely taken up. ## Investments In the year under review, PostFinance once again invested in the maintenance of the core banking system. For example, investments were made in the storage area network, data storage, data back- up and active data warehouse, and in its Postomat network. At the end of 2021, the real estate portfolio of 20 properties had a market value of 1.26 billion francs. PostFinance invested around 37 million francs in developing and preserving the value of its own portfolio in 2021. The completely renovated building on Baumackerstrasse in Zurich-Oerlikon was opened in autumn 2021. The investment volume in the year under review stood at 15 million francs. The rapid market absorption of the 54 newly developed apartments confirmed the usage strategy pursued of con- verting office to residential space. On the ground floor, Swiss Post opened its modernized branch. The Swiss Post units renting the property on Avenue de Tivoli in Fribourg optimized their logistics, retail and workplace requirements. Operational space was replaced by a call center covering around 1,100 square metres. It was put into operation by PostalNetwork in October 2021. The upgrading of the technical facilities is enabling the installation of more eco-friendly ventilation and cooling systems and offering an opportunity to provide retail space on the ground floor. In total, PostFinance invested 6 million francs in Fribourg. PostFinance made investments of over 2 million francs in the historic property at Geneva Mont-Blanc. Extensive renovation of the second floor means it can be sub-let in an optimal location with a very high fit-out standard. The Geneva Montbrillant property, situated next to the railway station, is being steadily transformed from a pure Swiss Post building into a marketable investment property. The restoration and recon- figuration of the building's 65,000 square metres absorbed investments of almost 7 million francs in 2021. PostFinance made additional investments by way of capital contributions in participations. <!-- PageNumber=\"30\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ## The interest differ- ential business is the most important source of income. ## Profit situation Operating income Operating income rose by 118 million francs overall. The interest differential business is the most important source of revenue for PostFinance. The on- going low interest situation is increasingly weighing on interest margins. This meant interest income on financial investments in its core business fell sharply again as a result of market conditions. It was offset by the negative interest expense in the deposit-taking business - in other words through cus- tomer asset fees - and greater activity on the interbank money market. In contrast to the previous year, the change in default-related value adjustments also resulted in reversals of impairment on financial investments in the 2021 financial year. Net interest income rose by 41 million francs overall. The result from services for cash inpayments at the counter was only slightly above the prior-year figure in 2021 despite price adjustments with effect from mid-2020. Higher income from cash in- payments was offset by an accelerated decline in transactions - also due to coronavirus - and lower capacity utilization at Swiss Post branches. The result from commission business increased due to the expansion of the range of investment products and revenue from e-trading and life insurance. While income from the use of credit cards again increased year-on-year, it remains below our expec- tations due to the limitations on travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. Commission business and services posted an increase of around 54 million francs overall. The result from trading activities rose by 23 million francs due to higher net income from foreign exchange trading and fair value changes in the result from trading portfolios. PostFinance customers again did significantly less travelling in 2021. With regard to revenues from currency conversions, PostFinance is seeing a general shift away from cash transactions from cus- tomer foreign exchange transactions and cash withdrawals in foreign currencies from ATMs at home and abroad towards cashless giro transactions abroad. Overall, the impact of the coronavirus pan- demic on the result for the 2021 financial year totalled around 28 million francs. ### Operating expenses Operating expenses were up by around 23 million francs on the prior year. Average headcount stood at 3,237 full-time equivalents, down by 23 full-time equivalents year-on- year. As part of its strategic focus, PostFinance is placing an emphasis on the simplification and dig- itization of its processes. Vacant positions were therefore only partly filled, while PostFinance focused its investments on new business areas and the specialists they require, in particular at the IT and Platform Business units. Personnel expenses rose by around 34 million francs compared to the prior year, which is mainly attributable to the change in the contributions to employee benefits schemes. The lifting of the waiver of use at the Swiss Post pension fund meant the employer contribution re- serves were recognized in profit and loss in the ARB financial statements in the 2020 financial year, leading to a reduction in expenses. In contrast, expenses were incurred during the 2021 financial year due to a one-off payment to the Swiss Post pension fund, the increased pension fund liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR 16 and a remeasurement of the loyalty bonuses/sabbaticals. The rise in personnel expenses contrasted with a decline in general and administrative expenses owing to lower external project costs and efficiency improvements from the implementation of the strategy. <!-- PageNumber=\"31\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements Income tax and extraordinary income No expenses for current income taxes were incurred due to the negative statutory result in the pre- vious years (result in accordance with the accounting rules for banks) and the associated loss carry- forward. Profit PostFinance recorded a profit under the accounting rules for banks (ARB) of 223 million francs for the 2021 financial year, which represents an increase of 94 million francs year-on-year. The result is also reflected in the key figures. Return on equity rose to 3.7 percent and the cost-in- come ratio declined thanks to a consistent focus on costs. However, once again no economic value added was generated in 2021. Reconciliation of the income statement from the Group segment disclosure with the PostFinance net annual result in accordance with \"Accounting - banks\". Swiss Post includes the financial services market segment in its reporting. It indicates transfers of individual income and expense items from PostFinance to other Group units from a Group perspec- tive. It also contains the consolidated perspective.

An extension of card acceptance is planned. ## Non-financial results of a material nature Customer satisfaction Satisfaction in 2021 stood at 80 points for PostFinance's private customers and 77 points for retail business customers on a scale of 0 to 100. Both values are just a point below the previous year's fig- ure. Despite the slight decline, around 90 percent of private customers and 85 percent of business customers indicated they are essentially satisfied with PostFinance. E-finance and TWINT were rated highly by survey participants, which is reflected in the consistently high satisfaction values of recent years. In contrast, participants were more critical of cash withdraw- al abroad and the acceptance of the PostFinance Card in general. PostFinance is addressing these points in 2022: it will combine the PostFinance Card and Debit Mastercard\u00ae to extend card accept- ance to even more points of sale in Switzerland and abroad. The launch of the new PostFinance App triggered numerous, in many cases negative, reactions. This led to a sharp decline in willingness to recommend the app in summer 2021. It improved to reach the previous year's level in autumn 2021 thanks to various optimization measures. Staff motivation At 83 percent, the rate of staff participation achieved in the employee survey was high again in 2021. The two sets of questions about commitment and the job generally received less approval this year, whereas satisfaction in this area remains at a high level. The values are very pleasing in view of the ongoing pandemic and major changes due to a reorganization. \"My work\" again received an average positive score of 77 points (2020: 79 points). The employees see a purpose in their job and rate the infrastructure and resources positively. Compared to the pre- vious year, they were more critical of the time available for the tasks to be completed. There are dif- ferences within the individual organizational units. \"My commitment\" also received an average positive score of 79 points (2020: 81 points). Even dur- ing times of change, employees still enjoy working at PostFinance, can recommend PostFinance as an employer and see their professional future here. Compared to employees without a line management function, leaders' responses to the questions were more positive (sometimes five to ten points higher), particularly on the topics of development opportunities, enjoyment of the work and willingness to recommend PostFinance as an employer. Further demographic differences are barely identifiable in the two sets of questions. ## Risk assessment The current negative interest rate environment continues to present PostFinance with major chal- lenges. One key aspect to note is that PostFinance is almost entirely exposed to the current interest environment when making new investments due to the lending prohibition and its investment ac- tivity on the money and capital markets. Despite the tense situation, PostFinance continues to pur- sue a cautious credit risk policy. This policy results in a very high-quality investment portfolio, which to date has seen only a negligible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The term structure of the investment portfolio is coordinated with the refinancing structure, resulting in balanced interest risk positioning. The environment for implementing negative interest rates in line with the capital mar- ket is continually improving, which means PostFinance's interest margin can be supported. The market risks taken are of secondary importance. Greater volatility on the markets only has lim- ited effects on the result achieved by PostFinance, for example. Market risks are measured and eval- uated rapidly. The liquidity situation at PostFinance remains very stable at a high level. As a rule, the major risks at PostFinance arise from the longer-term persistence of the current negative interest <!-- PageNumber=\"34\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> environment and from unexpected losses in the high-quality investment portfolio. Additional chal- lenges could emerge as a result of new regulatory developments that PostFinance is particularly exposed to due to the restricted flexibility in its business model imposed by law. PostFinance is less affected by increased market volatility thanks to a large fixed income portfolio. ### Customer transaction volumes The exemption regime in place at FINMA regarding the easing of the leverage ratio expired on 31 December 2020. Repo borrowings were therefore scaled back at the end of 2020. In the year under review 2021, total assets rose by around 4.5 billion francs. This is mainly due to increased ac- tivity in the interbank money market. Customer assets fell by 13 billion francs. Charging of customer asset fees had to be maintained due to the negative interest rates on sight deposit balances at the SNB. As a result of continuing pressure on its interest operations, PostFinance is increasingly obliged to pass on the negative market interest rates to its customers. Customer asset fees were still charged to some individual customers with assets above a particular exemption limit. The sight deposits of Corporates customers declined accordingly. In the second half of 2021, customer asset fees had to be extended to include private customers with assets of over 100,000 francs. As expected, these measures resulted in some cases in an outflow of customer deposits and a transfer of assets to funds and securities investments. The topic of invest- ment remains of strategic importance at PostFinance. PostFinance wants to increase awareness of its products, and is organizing successful campaigns on the subject of investment. In addition to e-trading, PostFinance now offers e-asset management, investment consulting plus, fund consulting basic and fund self-service. Customers can choose the level of support most appropriate to their needs. PostFinance provides services in the commission business, i.e. funds, e-trading and life insurance, in cooperation with partners. Customer assets in investment products stand at around 18.2 billion francs, representing growth of 26 percent year-on-year. In addition to an increase in e-trading assets, the four digital investment solutions, such as fund self-service, are also being widely taken up. In addition, investments with a focus on sustainability are becoming increasingly popular. For business customers, the savings and e-savings account services have been discontinued, as it is not possible to pay customer interest in the current market interest rate environment. This led to the closure of around 40,000 accounts and a transfer of customer deposits into payment accounts. For private customers, the introduction of the new banking packages led to the consolidation of cus- tomer files into one primary banking relationship and the closure of inactive accounts, and in some cases to terminations of customer relationships. PostFinance processed 1,265 million payment transactions, which amounts to an increase of 6.2 per- cent year-on-year. Overall, PostFinance customers carried out transactions representing a total vol- ume of well over 1,900 billion francs. These figures illustrate the importance of PostFinance in the Swiss financial services market. The coronavirus crisis also caused a sharp drop in revenues from over-the-counter transactions at Swiss Post branches and from ATM transactions in 2021. In addition, trading portfolio assets saw no substantial conversion gains from cash withdrawals in foreign currencies and from the use of credit cards as a result of the restrictions on travel for PostFinance customers. Inpayments at branches are being replaced by electronic processing. In addition to e-finance, particular growth is being seen in cashless transaction volumes in trading activities (EFT/POS) and in the area of digital commerce with e-payment and TWINT transactions. <!-- PageNumber=\"35\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements #### 2021 milestones Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly enshrined in PostFinance's strategy and has been operation- alized since 2021. The policy goes much further than simply complying with legal standards. \"We aim to assume responsibility by showing courage, commitment and vision - only then is banking enjoyable and meaningful,\" says Hansruedi Kong, CEO of PostFinance. \"The challenges we face are as great as the opportunities they present - more specifically, becoming an even more innovative and diversified financial service provider.\" PostFinance has defined five specific and measurable impact goals. It promotes the active commit- ment of its employees to corporate responsibility. It aims to gradually reduce its CO2 footprint and - as part of Swiss Post - become carbon neutral by 2040 in terms of both its own and indirect emis- sions. It provides sustainable market services in investment and retirement planning. In relation to innovations, PostFinance focuses on sustainable finance. It also promotes diversity with an empha- sis on gender equality. For the first time a disclosure of climate-related financial risks was produced and published for the 2021 financial year, which supports PostFinance's commitment to greater transparency. Innovation The start of the new strategy period also meant changes for the PFLab, PostFinance's innovation center. The innovation and venturing teams and PostFinance's related initiatives presented them- selves as VNTR | Innovation & Venturing (pronounced \"venture\") from mid-2021. While PostFinance is dedicated to its core business (day-to-day activities), the digital transformation and the strategy implementation, VNTR focuses on what's new, future-oriented topics, technologies and business models that have not yet been embraced by PostFinance. This is achieved both by validating inno- vation projects directly on the market, and by investing in startups (corporate venturing). It enables opportunities to be seized and any blind spots to be identified. Knowledge and competencies are also being developed for future capabilities. To systematically identify new areas of innovation and innovation projects, the foresight process was further professionalized (process for systematically exploring the future). The innovation manage- ment software ITONICS was introduced as well. Based on the experiences gained in the innovation environment, VNTR developed the failbook and success book in the year under review. Both innovation books provide insights into successful and failed innovations early on. Enriched with a great deal of innovation know-how, expertise and ex- traordinary images and illustrations, the innovation books are also ideal for training purposes. In early 2021, CredRep launched a full service for private individuals that allows them to obtain ex- tracts from the debt collection register with a digital signature, or digital CreditTrust certificates (as a new alternative). Real estate and credit portals as well as software solution providers can easily integrate this service. CredRep was established in close collaboration between the innovation parti- cipation tilbago and VNTR | Innovation & Venturing. At Swiss Post, customers can use CredRep to obtain a physical extract from the debt collection register at the counter, but also an extract in fully digital format. The solution is also being provided at PostFinance in recruiting new employees, while a link to it is available on Valuu's homepage and in the documents of PostFinance's mortgage process. The retirement planning and coverage check miira underwent further development and will con- tinue to be operated on the mortgage brokerage platform Valuu. <!-- PageNumber=\"36\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> As part of the cardossier ecosystem, whose aim is to map a vehicle's life cycle on the blockchain, the use case \"registration of new vehicles\" was launched. Payment and initial implementation options were assessed by VNTR. Based on a successful feasibility trial, the functionality was developed to enable business customers to provide their own customers with rapid identification. In a first application, interested PostFinance customers who provide their consent will receive simplified access to the digital smartphone bank Yuh. The innovation project Green Coin/Swiss Climate Challenge was further developed and tested in a broader context. It combines digitization and climate change, two of today's major drivers of inno- vation: a green ecosystem for companies promoting a more sustainable lifestyle for their employees and customers, for brands that wish to reach an eco-conscious audience and for a society that needs to achieve sustainability goals. With Green Coin, PostFinance has issued a purpose-specific cryp- tographic currency for the first time. The Green Coins act as an incentive mechanism for sustainable behaviour. During the trial, they were earned by the users - around 2,000 employees of PostFinance, Swiss Post and Swisscom - and could only be used on the integrated marketplace of the Swiss Cli- mate Challenge for sustainable products or donations. In 2021, amongst the fields of innovation explored, digital assets proved particularly relevant, which is why feasibility studies and analysis will be stepped up in this area to evaluate potential services. Development of products and services Irrespective of the upcoming political decisions, PostFinance is pressing ahead with its transforma- tion to become the number one digital bank in Switzerland. Over 1.9 million customers have access to e-finance. The app is already being actively used by 800,000 customers. This makes PostFinance the ideal partner for everyone who wants to manage their own finances as easily as possible. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh The Swiss mobile banking market is undergoing rapid change. PostFinance and Swissquote launched the joint digital banking app Yuh. Yuh has been available for download in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store since May 2021. The newly founded joint venture aims to consistently adopt fresh approaches in mobile banking. Yuh wants to provide people with an app on their mobile phones that gives them the freedom to manage their money as they wish. And with partners in the back- ground whom they know and can trust. The companies behind Yuh - PostFinance and Swissquote - are both leading providers of online financial services with many years of experience on the Swiss market. The joint solution was newly developed from scratch. The really revolutionary thing about Yuh is its 3-in-1 mix: with the app on their smartphone, customers can not only make payments and save for projects, goals or wishes, they can also invest large or very small sums of money in more than 100 of the world's most popular shares, ETFs, trending themes or selected cryptocurrencies. Valuu extended its platform business services by adding transparent comparison options for private loans PostFinance extended its range of services through the platform business model Valuu. As a mort- gage brokerage and comparison platform, Valuu launched the B2C model between mortgage seek- ers and providers in 2019. The Valuu platform enables mortgage customers to compare and take out a wide range of mortgages through completely digitized channels by bringing together mort- gage seekers and lenders using a matching algorithm. People looking for a loan do not simply receive the least expensive but rather the best or most suitable mortgage for them. Customers receive their first personalized offers in the Valuu app in a few, simple steps. Via the customer journey, the mort- gage requested is bindingly taken out digitally, and using a hybrid advisory approach if necessary. <!-- PageNumber=\"37\" --> Foreword <!-- PageHeader=\"Interview\" --> Corporate governance \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements 364 million francs of finance was provided via Valuu in 2021. Valuu currently has around 18,500 registered users and works with 31 lenders, covering over 100 leading Swiss banks, insurance com- panies and pension funds. In addition to its core business of B2C mortgages, Valuu is focusing on expanding the B2B2C business model Valuu Pro for mortgage brokers and establishing it on the market. The platform currently has over 25 active partners. Valuu Pro is a tool (software as a service) that essentially enables any advisor or provider (broker) to efficiently arrange a mortgage for an end customer (borrower) via the platform. Valuu is testing new development paths in various pivots. In the financing sub-market, the personal loan comparison of the six largest lenders was added to the product range. PostFinance bundled its accounts and services in the new Smart and SmartPlus banking packages The banking packages provide private customers with everything they need to manage their day- to-day finances, tailored to their requirements. Customers can save on fees by opting not to receive documents such as account, interest and credit card statements in paper format, or if they have in- vested assets of over 25,000 francs, a mortgage or a life insurance policy with PostFinance. Invested assets include fund investments, including retirement funds, and custody account assets in e-trading (excluding cash). PostFinance assigned all private customers to one of the new banking packages based on their previous usage behaviour. All customers received a letter and notification in e-finance informing them about the new banking packages and their allocation. For children, young people and young students in education, PostFinance offers three attractive, free banking packages: Smart- Kids, SmartYoung and SmartStudents. With the acquisition of Paynet's customers, PostFinance is underlining the importance of e-invoicing PostFinance is now Switzerland's leader in the payment transactions market. It intends to develop this strong position and become a national payment champion by 2030. For retailers and invoice issuers in Switzerland, PostFinance will be the reliable partner for payment and billing solutions. They benefit from an attractive price model tailored to Swiss requirements and adapted services. Its e-in- voicing services have created a network of relationships in the B2B environment over many years. It links PostFinance customers to many of their customers and suppliers, and supports the digitization of invoicing at Swiss SMEs and major corporations. This positive development is one of the main reasons why PostFinance decided to acquire Paynet's e-invoicing business. By taking over Paynet's customers, PostFinance is highlighting the significance of e-invoicing as one of its most relevant strategic business areas within payment transactions, as well as its vital importance, in its view, to the success of its customers. Federal Council assistance programme: PostFinance permitted to grant loans up to 500,000 francs The measures taken by the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus have far-reaching economic consequences. One of them is that numerous companies have fewer and fewer liquid assets at their disposal to cover their ongoing costs. For this reason, the Federal Council adopted a comprehensive package of measures in 2020 to cushion the economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus for these companies. Among other things, the affected companies were to quickly and easily receive loan amounts of up to 10 percent of annual turnover or a maximum of 20 million francs. It was possible for banks to pay out loans of up to 500,000 francs immediately after the pro- cessing of an extremely simplified, standardized loan application. These loans were fully guaranteed by the Confederation. PostFinance had urged the Federal Council to allow it to participate in this assistance package alongside other banks, despite the lending prohibition, in order to be able to contribute to the common good. As at 31 December 2021, there were just under 15,000 contracts with a credit limit of around 700 million francs. Out of this total, around 53 percent were used by the end of 2021. <!-- PageNumber=\"38\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ##### Corporate venturing Since 2016, PostFinance has been investing via participations in startup companies. At the end of 2021, the portfolio comprised 14 participations in innovative young companies. One of the aims of corporate venturing is to create opportunities for developing PostFinance's range of products and services. The collaboration with TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG is worth highlighting. By par- ticipating in and cooperating with innovative companies, PostFinance is ensuring the feasibility of white label insurance services. PostFinance car insurance is the major driver in this respect. As well as car insurance, PostFinance has now added further insurance products to its range, including mo- torcycle insurance, travel insurance and legal protection insurance. The cooperation enables Post- Finance to provide an improved customer experience for insurance products and to participate long-term in the success of the white label insurance portfolio of TONI Digital Insurance Solutions AG. The TWINT ecosystem is developing well from both a cooperation and participation standpoint. When launching the TWINT+ marketplace in 2020, TWINT established a strategic partnership with RaiseNow for donations. The cash withdrawal service was also integrated into the TWINT ecosystem in the year under review, while a cooperation with the start-up Sonect was also entered into. As the founder and shareholder of TWINT, PostFinance is participating in both RaiseNow and Sonect. Be- sides an improved customer experience, PostFinance can also benefit financially from these partner- ships and the resulting network effects. <!-- PageNumber=\"39\" --> Foreword Interview <!-- PageHeader=\"Corporate governance\" --> \\- Management report Statutory annual financial statements ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates.

Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates.

Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Monitoring by defining reporting limits for operational top risks. Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation).

Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

        "value": "The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies."

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Monitoring by defining reporting limits for operational top risks. Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis.

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Monitoring by defining reporting limits for operational top risks. Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation."

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis."

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS)."

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

        "value": "The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction."

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Monitoring by defining reporting limits for operational top risks. Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline."

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Monitoring by defining reporting limits for operational top risks. Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles.

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Monitoring by defining reporting limits for operational top risks. Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

        "value": "Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties."

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Monitoring by defining reporting limits for operational top risks. Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board.

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

        "value": "The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories."

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

The true and fair view statutory single-entity financial statements give an accurate picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations of the company in accordance with the Accounting rules for banks, securities firms, financial groups and conglomerates. Individual report figures are rounded in the notes for publication, while calculations are carried out using the non-rounded figures. Small rounding differences may therefore occur. #### Foreign currency translation Balance sheet items in foreign currency are converted at the foreign exchange rates valid at the end of the year. Any resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Income and expenses are converted at the applicable daily rates. Closing rates 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 EUR 1.0841 1.0347 USD 0.8820 0.9144 GBP 1.2026 1.2348 JPY 0.0086 0.0079 ##### Offsetting As a rule, no offsetting takes place, except in the cases set out below. Receivables and payables are offset if all the following conditions are met: the receivables and payables arise from transactions of the same type with the same counterparty, with the same maturity or earlier maturity of the receiv- able and in the same currency, and cannot lead to a counterparty risk. Value adjustments are de- ducted from the corresponding asset item. ###### Trade date/settlement date accounting As a rule, securities transactions are recognized on the trade date. Concluded foreign exchange and money market transactions are recognized in the balance sheet on the settlement date (value date). Foreign exchange transactions are recognized in the balance sheet in positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments until their settlement date. <!-- PageNumber=\"49\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements General valuation policies The detailed positions of items in the balance sheet are valued separately (item-by-item valuation). Liquid assets, amounts due from banks and amounts due from securities financing transactions These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Cash outflows arising from reverse repurchase transactions are presented as amounts due from securities financing transactions. Finan- cial investments obtained from transactions as collateral are generally not recognized in the balance sheet. Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions is accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are recorded at the value of the cash deposits that have been received or made. Securities borrowed or received as collateral are only recognized in the balance sheet if PostFinance gains control over the contractual rights associated with these securities. Securities lent and provided as collateral are only taken off the balance sheet if PostFinance loses the contractual rights associated with these securities. The fair values of the se- curities borrowed and lent are monitored on a daily basis in order to provide or claim additional collateral where required. Securities cover for reverse repurchase and securities lending transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Fees received or paid in relation to securities lend- ing and repurchase transactions are stated in the result from commission business and services. Amounts due from customers and mortgage loans These items are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value or acquisition cost less value adjustments for impaired loans/receivables and expected losses. Any premiums and discounts re- lated to amounts due from customers are accrued over the term. Receivables are classed as impaired at the latest when the contractually agreed payments of capital and/or interest are more than 90 days outstanding. Interest outstanding for more than 90 days is regarded as overdue. Value adjustments that are no longer economically necessary are released to income. All value adjustments are deduct- ed directly from this item in the balance sheet. Overdue interest, the collection of which is impaired, is no longer accrued as income, but is reported without interest when its collection is so doubtful that the accrual of such interest is no longer deemed appropriate. If a receivable is considered entirely or partially uncollectible or a debt waiver has been granted, the amount of the receivable is derecognized from the corresponding value ad- justment. Trading portfolio assets Securities held for trading acquired primarily with the aim of achieving short-term gains by making targeted use of fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these securities are recorded in the result from trading activities and the fair value option. Interest and dividend income from securities held for trading is recognized under net interest income. Where, as an exception, no fair value is ascertainable, valuation and recognition are to follow the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments which are not accounted for under the hedge accounting rules or which do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are treated as instruments held for trading. Derivative financial instruments acquired for trading purposes are recognized at fair val- ue and are subsequently measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied if derivative financial instruments are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged items. The effectiveness of these hedges is reviewed every six months. Fair value hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the hedged underlying instrument are recognized in the income statement. <!-- PageNumber=\"50\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated future transactions. Changes in value to the extent a hedge is effective are allocated to the compensation account, while changes in value to the extent a hedge is ineffective are recognized in profit or loss. Positive and negative replacement values for all derivatives are recognized at fair value in positive replacement values of derivative financial in- struments or negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments. ####### Financial investments Financial investments with a fixed maturity that PostFinance intends and is able to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost (accrual method) less impairment for expected losses. The effective interest method spreads the difference between the acquisition cost and the repayment amount (premium/discount) over the life of the investment in question using the present value method. The fair values of financial instruments are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques (present value method, etc.). In the case of listed financial instruments, the fair values correspond to market prices provided that such prices have been set on a price-efficient and liquid market. If financial investments intended to be held to maturity are sold or repaid prior to maturity, the gains or losses realized that correspond to the interest component are accrued over the remain- ing term. Holdings in equity securities (shares) are valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Debt securities acquired without the intention of being held to maturity are also valued according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value. Recoveries of receivables written off in prior periods are credited to this item in the balance sheet. #### Establishing amounts for value adjustments The expected loss method as per IFRS 9 is used to establish amounts for value adjustments. Depend- ing on the change in credit risk since acquisition, debt securities, amounts due from securities financ- ing transactions, amounts due from customers and amounts due from banks belong to one of three levels for the calculation of value adjustments. Depending on the level, the value adjustment match- es the expected loss over the next year (level 1) or the expected losses over the remaining term to maturity of an instrument (levels 2-3). The expected losses over the next year depend on the expo- sure of the position included in the default risk, on the probability of default of the instrument for the relevant year due to economic trends, and on an expected loss given default. The lifetime ex- pected losses depend on the probability of default of the position due to economic trends over the remaining term to maturity, on its current and future exposure included in the default risk, and on an expected loss given default. At the time of acquisition, a financial instrument with intrinsic value is allocated to level 1. A transi- tion to level 2 takes place if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. There is a significant increase in credit risk if the current rating of a position is below a defined thresh- old. The threshold applied depends on the original rating of the position. Due to the exponential nature of the probability of default, the relative change in the probability of default must be higher, the better the rating at the time an instrument was acquired. The assigned rating corresponds to the rating issued by recognized rating agencies. If no such rating exists, the ratings of non-recognized rating agencies (e.g. ratings of qualified banks) are used. A payment delay of more than 30 days also serves as a criterion for a move to level 2. In addition, a dedicated committee assesses whether there is a significant rise in credit risk for positions under special consideration, leading to a reclassification to level 2. This affects the following positions: those that have a non investment-grade rating, those whose spread exceeds a defined value, those that are lower tier 2 positions or those that do not have an external rating. If an event of default is present on the balance sheet date, the position is allocated to level 3. An event of default is present if PostFinance assumes that there is a strong prob- ability that the debtor will be unable to meet their payment obligations in full and as agreed, if a D rating (default) applies or if the liability is more than 90 days overdue from the counterparty. If a position has been allocated to levels 2 or 3, it can again be transferred to level 1 or 2 as soon as the criteria for that level have been satisfied. <!-- PageNumber=\"51\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The value adjustment of a financial instrument is measured using the following parameters: default probability, credit loss ratio and credit exposure at the time of default. As PostFinance has not re- corded any bond defaults in the past and invests primarily in highly rated bonds, there are no inter- nal default time series available in order to estimate default probabilities on this basis. For this reason, default probabilities are derived from migration matrices from external sources. These derived de- fault probabilities are adjusted periodically based on the expected economic trends. A negative economic situation is assumed, so stressed probabilities of default have been applied for the finan- cial year. The model parameters for the credit loss rate for various types of product are derived from various external sources by means of an expert opinion. A dedicated committee can override the credit loss rate of specific positions if necessary. Credit exposure at the time of default generally cor- responds to amortized cost or forecasted amortized cost plus outstanding interest. Value adjustments are calculated on amounts due from private and business accounts and associ- ated limits on a collective basis. The portfolios used were generated on the basis of the characteris- tics applied in product management. Receivables are allocated to level 1 on initial recognition. They are allocated to levels 2 or 3 when the overdue period defined for the relevant level has been ex- ceeded. The default rate used to determine the calculation of expected loss is calculated using his- torical data for a switch to level 2 or level 3. On the balance sheet date the previously calculated default probability is verified in order to determine whether an adjustment is needed on the basis of current and forward-looking information. The value adjustment for amounts due from banks is measured based on the default risk of outstanding loans or their credit rating. Participations All equity securities in companies intended to be held as long-term investments are reported as par- ticipations. These items are included in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less economically nec- essary depreciation in accordance with the individual valuation principle. The fair values of partici- pations for the purposes of impairment testing at least once a year are determined on the basis of stock market prices and valuation techniques such as the discounted cashflow method or using the venture capital approach. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depre- ciation. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is as follows: \\- IT infrastructure 3-4 years \\- Postomats 10 years \\- Software 3-10 years \\- Real estate 10-50 years Assets associated with the purchase, installation and development of software are capitalized if they are of measurable economic benefit. Regular checks are carried out to determine if there are signs of overvaluation. If this is the case, the book value is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). If the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment equal to the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount is recognized in profit or loss. Gains realized from the disposal of tangible fixed assets are recorded in extraordinary income, while realized losses are recognized as extraordinary expenses. <!-- PageNumber=\"52\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years. If an assessment on the balance sheet date shows that the capitalization of a proportion of intangible assets is no longer justified, the proportion in question is additionally depreciated on the relevant date. An assessment is carried out if there are any indications of impairment. Accrued income and prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and deferred income Interest receivable and payable, commission and other income and expenses during the accounting period are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle to ensure that they are cor- rectly represented in the income statement. Amounts due to banks, liabilities from securities financing transactions and amounts due in respect of customer deposits Private and business accounts are included in the balance sheet at their nominal value. Financial investments transferred as collateral as part of repurchase transactions continue to be recognized in the balance sheet under \"Financial investments\". Interest expenses from repurchase transactions are accounted for using the accrual-based accounting principle. Securities cover for repurchase and securities borrowing transactions is recognized on a daily basis at current fair values. Amounts bor- rowed from banks and holders of qualified participations and cash bonds are recorded on the bal- ance sheet at nominal value. #### Provisions Provisions are made according to objective criteria for all risks detectable on the balance sheet date and presented under this item in the balance sheet. Provisions that are no longer economically nec- essary are released to income. Provisions for expected losses are made for off-balance sheet trans- actions. The method used is analogous to value adjustments on expected losses. Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to pay up shares and make further contributions These items are recorded at their nominal value as off-balance sheet transactions. Pension benefit obligations The accounting treatment of pension benefit obligations at PostFinance Ltd is based on Swiss GAAP ARR 16/26. PostFinance employees are insured with the Swiss Post pension fund foundation under a Duoprimat (combined defined benefit and defined contribution) scheme in accordance with the Federal Law on the Occupational Old-age, Survivors' and Disability Benefit Plan (OPA). Staff are thereby insured against the financial consequences of old age, death and disability. The retirement benefits of all active members are calculated on a defined contribution basis and the risk cover (death and disability) on a defined benefit basis. Expenses related to pension benefit obligations are rec- ognized in personnel expenses. Pension benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of benefits for the employee's eligible insurance period and take the future into account by including statistical probabilities such as death and disability. The employer contribution reserve is part of the Swiss Post pension fund. A future economic benefit is calculated and capitalized based on the last available and audited financial statements from the Swiss Post pension fund foundation. <!-- PageNumber=\"53\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Taxes Income tax is determined on the basis of the accrued net annual results in the relevant reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are calculated at the current tax rate. Accruals and deferrals are rec- ognized in the balance sheet under accrued income and prepaid expenses or accrued expenses and deferred income. The tax consequences of time differences between the values of assets and liabilities shown in the balance sheet and their tax bases are recognized as deferred taxes under provisions. Deferred taxes are determined separately in each business period. Changes in the accounting and valuation principles versus the previous year PostFinance has reviewed all contracts, systems and models affected by the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference interest rates. The work required for contract amendments, system and model adjustments and the conversion of business transactions to alternative reference rates is com- pleted, with the exception of interest rate swaps. Based on the current commitment and business model, PostFinance is less severely affected by the replacement of LIBOR than other institutions. PostFinance has adopted the ISDA standards for interest rate swaps. The expected impact of the changeover of the interest rate swaps that have not yet been converted from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates is less than 1 million francs at PostFinance. Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting PostFinance uses derivative financial instruments exclusively to hedge interest and currency risks. The bond market in Swiss francs is not sufficient to cover PostFinance's investment requirements. It therefore also invests in foreign currency bonds. As a general rule, two methods are used to hedge foreign currency risks. A proportion of the foreign currency bonds refinanced in Swiss francs are hedged by means of cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS). The advantage of this hedging ap- proach is that the amounts of all future cash flows (coupons, nominal value repayment) in Swiss francs are already known on the date of conclusion of the transaction. However, it rules out the di- versification benefits associated with the varying amounts and performance of term spreads of dif- ferent foreign currency yield curves. To take advantage of this diversification potential and access bond markets on which CCIRS are only available with high illiquidity discounts, the currency risks of certain foreign currency bonds are hedged by means of a currency overlay of rolling short-term for- eign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards). The foreign currency risks of the other financial instruments are also hedged on a rolling basis using FX forwards. Interest rate swaps are used to control duration on the assets side. Long (short) duration bonds are transformed into short (long) duration bonds by means of interest rate swaps. In principle, interest rate swaps are used to control the maturity transformation strategy in the overall balance sheet. PostFinance mainly uses hedge accounting in connection with bonds (hedging of interest and cur- rency risks by means of interest rate/interest rate currency swaps). Hedging is by means of micro- hedges. Economic relationship between hedged items and hedging transactions PostFinance records the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item on the date on which a financial instrument is classed as a hedging relationship. The information recorded includes the risk management objectives and strategy of the hedging transaction, and the methods used to measure the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction is constantly measured on a prospective basis in the course of effectiveness tests by measuring factors such as inverse performance and its correlation. <!-- PageNumber=\"54\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> Effectiveness measurement Hedging is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met: \\- Hedging is considered to be highly effective upon its initial recognition (on a prospective basis via the critical terms match method). \\- There is a close economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging transaction. \\- There is an inverse relationship between the value changes of the hedged item and those of the hedging transaction with regard to the hedged risk. #### Ineffectiveness If this results in an ineffective portion, this is recognized in the income statement for the period in question. PostFinance analyses the fair value of the hedged item to determine the ineffectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the deci- sive terms of the hedged item and there is a fair value of zero at the beginning of the hedging rela- tionship. Events after the balance sheet date On the date of issue of the annual financial statements, no material events had occurred as at 31 De- cember 2021 which would have to be disclosed in the financial statements and/or in the notes. ## 3 Risk management Business model and risk profile PostFinance operates mainly in the fields of payment transaction services, the receipt of customer deposits, account services and related services. It also handles customer securities trading, carries out investments in its own name, and manages other financial services on behalf of third parties. On account of its business model, PostFinance is exposed to risks. PostFinance could suffer losses or deviations from the expected result if these risks materialize. PostFinance defines three risk categories based on its business model. \\- Financial risk refers to the risk of unexpected losses from the investment and deposit business. In terms of financial risks, PostFinance differentiates between interest rate, market, credit and liquidity risks. \\- Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the fundamental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments. \\- Operational risk refers to the risk of unexpected costs or unwelcome events (such as events with a negative impact on reputation or compliance breaches) that arise as a result of the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external events. Operational risks also include the risks associated with financial reporting. ### Governance and reporting In formal terms, the business control and monitoring process and the entire internal control system comply with the COSO Il framework and \"three lines of defence\" concept. The COSO II framework incorporates risk management as well as risk control and monitoring. PostFinance also uses the ISO 31000 standard as a guideline. The Board of Directors defines the risk policy and principles of risk management and is responsible for the regulation, establishment and monitoring of an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for ensuring an appropriate risk and control environment within PostFinance. The Board of Directors uses the definition of risk appetite to determine the total amount of risk that PostFinance is prepared to take. The risk appetite takes strategic, financial and operational risks into account and must be in line with the company's risk capacity. The risk capacity results from the regulatory and legal requirements to be met, adherence to which enables PostFinance to continue as a going con- cern. In addition, the risk appetite takes the directives and guidelines of the owner into account. <!-- PageNumber=\"55\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements The Board of Directors and all Board of Directors' Committees (Risk, Audit & Compliance, IT & Digi- tization, Organisation, Nomination & Remuneration) apply these risk principles. The Risk and Audit & Compliance Committees have a special role to play here, as they perform an explicit monitoring function at Board level, with the Board of Directors' Audit & Compliance Committee focusing in par- ticular on non-financial risks and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on financial risks. The PostFinance Executive Board is responsible for implementing the directives of the Board of Di- rectors with regard to risk management and monitoring within the framework of the 1st and 2nd lines of defence (LoD), and ensures compliance with the risk capacity and risk appetite. It implements the directives of the Board of Directors with regard to the establishment, maintenance and regular re- view of control activities and the control units involved. In addition, the Executive Board is responsi- ble for the active management of financial, strategic and operational risks within the framework defined by the Board of Directors and ensures that the risk management infrastructure throughout the institution meets requirements in organizational, human resources, technical and methodology terms. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is a member of the Executive Board and is responsible for ensur- ing that the subordinated control entities perform the tasks entrusted to them. The business units which represent the 1st LoD bear primary responsibility for the risks from their unit and exercise their control function in the management of risks, in particular through their iden- tification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting activities. They take account of the di- rectives of the 2nd LoD and ensure that their risks and controls are complete and up-to-date in the risk and control inventory. Within the 1st LoD, there are units that are accountable for results and units with no direct accountability for results, which act for example as support units for other units or the Executive Board. The Risk Management unit supports decision-makers with the management and monitoring of financial risks in the overall balance sheet. It identifies, models and measures the financial risks entered into and proposes control measures. It also monitors and reports their effec- tiveness to decision-makers on a regular basis. The Compliance Services unit ensures compliance with statutory provisions and guidelines in business operations and at the customer interface in accordance with the directives of the 2nd LoD. The management of security risks at the operational level is the responsibility of the Security unit. The units in the 2nd LoD independently monitor risk management in the 1st LoD, ensuring that all risks are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported across the Group. At PostFinance, the Governance, Compliance and Risk Control units are the control entities respon- sible for the 2nd LoD function. The independence of the 2nd LoD units from the 1st LoD units is ensured in organizational terms by the fact that these units are located in the business unit of the CRO. As independent control entities, the 2nd LoD units monitor the established risk profile with suitable instruments, provide a central overview of PostFinance's risk situation and report it to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. They also issue directives on the assurance of compliance with internal and external provisions and define methods and procedures for risk man- agement. Risk Control independently monitors all risks that are not monitored by Compliance or Governance. This applies to financial risks, operational risks, security risks and strategic risks. Risk Control contin- uously monitors the risk situation in these areas, reviews central risk management processes, meth- ods for risk measurement and assessment and risk monitoring systems in the 1st LoD, and monitors their correct implementation and application. Risk Control defines appropriate directives and pro- cesses for identifying, measuring, assessing and controlling the risks taken by PostFinance. Risk Control provides a suitable system for maintaining an inventory of all risks, risk management strategies, controls and events. As a unit in the 2nd LoD, it ensures that the 1st LoD units keep the in- ventory complete and up-to-date and validates the inventory on an ongoing basis with regard to completeness and correctness. Compliance independently monitors adherence to legal, regulatory and internal provisions relating to money laundering, tax compliance and the provision of financial services. Governance inde- <!-- PageNumber=\"56\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> pendently monitors compliance by staff with the rules of governance as a whole and with the Code of Conduct. Risk Control and Compliance inform the Board of Directors and the Executive Board about serious compliance breaches or matters of major significance. The 2nd LoD units jointly report at least quarterly to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the development of PostFinance's risk profile. In addition, matters of major importance are re- ported to the Board of Directors by the units in the 2nd LoD promptly and on an ad hoc basis. Risk Control coordinates the reporting activities of all 2nd LoD functions. As the 3rd LoD, Internal Auditing is responsible for risk monitoring and for overseeing the 1st and 2nd LoDs. It reports directly to the Board of Directors of PostFinance.

Level-appropriate addressing of risks through the definition of approval limits and thresholds for risk management measures for individual risks. PostFinance measures and monitors financial risks both at individual portfolio level and with regard to the overall balance sheet. Risks are limited by means of a multi-dimensional limit system. A variety of methods of differing degrees of complexity are used by Risk Management to measure <!-- PageNumber=\"57\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements financial risks. In concrete terms, they include scenario analyses (e.g. to measure the earnings effects of interest rate risks or the full utilization of credit risk limits), sensitivity analyses (e.g. to measure the present value effects arising from interest rate risks) and stochastic models to determine value-at- risk or expected shortfall risk indicators (e.g. to measure market risks or to quantify economic con- centration risks in the credit portfolio). The principal aim of risk measurement is to allow the super- visory bodies to control risks adequately at all times. All risks of PostFinance are assessed on the basis of a credible worst case scenario (CWC). The CWC represents a dire but nevertheless realistic loss scenario associated with a risk. The CWC covers both probability of occurrence and extent of loss in a quantitative and/or qualitative form. This assessment is undertaken for both gross and residual risk, i.e. after implementation of the risk management strategy. Individual risks are assessed using threshold values with regard to the obligation to record and the necessity of control measures. Approval limits for individual risks are used to ensure that risks and the associated risk management strategy are acknowledged and approved at the appropriate level. At a higher level, the risks in the risk inventory are used by the Executive Board and Board of Direc- tors for the top-down definition of top risks that are of central importance to PostFinance and have a high level of management attention. Operational top risks are measured by aggregating the re- spective individual risk clusters. These top risks and other aggregated risk positions are assigned to a warning level which if exceeded triggers a notification to the Board of Directors. Stress testing The Risk Management unit regularly carries out an inverse stress test to identify developments which could pose a particular threat to PostFinance. This test identifies scenarios in which a specific meas- ure of risk takes on extremely unfavourable values. The results of the inverse stress tests are discussed by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. As well as being used for control purposes, stress tests are also applied in the Risk Control depart- ment as a monitoring tool for recognizing significant (new) risks, to determine risk concentrations and to verify the appropriateness of risk appetite in stress situations. Financial risk management at PostFinance Credit risks PostFinance was granted a banking licence on 26 June 2013. Even with a banking licence, Post- Finance is not permitted to issue direct loans and mortgages due to postal legislation provisions. Interest-bearing customer deposits therefore do not go towards granting mortgages, but are invest- ed on the money and capital markets. PostFinance pursues a conservative investment strategy. Liquidity and creditworthiness are the main criteria for its investment decisions. The cluster risk is deliberately limited by holding financial investments that are broadly diversified in terms of the sec- tors, countries and counterparties. The term \"credit risk\" refers to the risk that a counterparty will no longer be able to fulfil its obliga- tions, thereby causing the creditor to incur a financial loss. In addition, a sharp decline in the credit- worthiness of a counterparty can trigger additional impairment requirements for the creditor. Cred- it risk increases as counterparties become more concentrated in an individual sector or region. Economic developments affecting whole sectors or regions can threaten the creditworthiness or solvency of an entire group of otherwise unrelated counterparties. To limit the credit risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover credit risks. It also determines directives on the investment rating structure, limits potential country risks and delegates responsi- bility for approving major counterparty limits to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee. New invest- <!-- PageNumber=\"58\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ments are generally only permitted if the debtor has a rating and its creditworthiness is classed as investment grade. In addition to the portfolio limits defined by the Board of Directors, the credit risks associated with investment activities are restricted by the Executive Board by setting counterparty limits and other control requirements. The directives for counterparty limits are based on publicly accessible ratings by recognized rating agencies and qualified banks, and on internal limit systems, with ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance) also being taken into account. Climate-specific finance risks are also analysed and taken into account as part of the ESG criteria. By means of quantitative and risk-oriented qualitative analyses of balance sheet key figures and early warning indicators, publicly accessible ratings in the limit systems are examined critically and limits derived from them, taking into account the current portfolio. The Risk Management unit is responsible for developing and applying internal limit sys- tems. These limit systems are approved and released by the Executive Board at least once a year. Changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or of relevant key figures result in the immediate ad- justment of the directives. Compliance with prescribed limits is monitored on an ongoing basis and is verified by the Treasury unit before the closing of each transaction. The economic concentration risks in the credit portfolio are taken into consideration in defining the portfolio and counterparty limits. To measure them, PostFinance uses a credit portfolio model that quantifies the credit risks within the credit portfolio while taking into account correlation effects. On the basis of the modelled risk indicators (expected shortfall and the relevant risk contributions of sub-portfolios), limits and control requirements can be defined in such a way that they increase portfolio efficiency and/or limit concentration risks. The Risk Management unit informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used in monthly reports. It submits risk control proposals where limits have been exceeded, resulting from adjustments to counterparty limits. As an integral part of credit risk management, the limit systems are subjected to regular checks by Risk Control. Credit risks arising from customer transactions are of secondary importance at PostFinance, and are due to account overdraft limits proposed in connection with payment transaction services, and to the range of credit cards available. The credit risks taken are established and monitored by means of product-specific processes. The Executive Board issues general directives on credit checks and au- thorizations for approving individual limits. Note on collateral concentration risks: Collateral concentration risks may arise when carrying out repo transactions (financial investments in exchange for collateral) and securities lending transactions (securities lending in exchange for collateral). The collateral protects PostFinance against the counterparty default risk, as it can be re- alized by PostFinance in the event of default by the counterparty. Concentrations of securities deliv- ered (with the exception of cash collateral) are measured, monitored and reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. At the same time, wrong-way risks are assessed and risk control proposals submitted where concentrations have been identified. Note on credit risks arising from mortgage lending The mortgage lending solutions offered in cooperation with M\u00fcnchener Hypothekenbank eG (MHB) since June 2008 and with Valiant Bank AG since 2010 do not result in any credit risks for PostFinance. These are borne entirely by the partner bank. <!-- PageNumber=\"59\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Interest rate risk and balance sheet structure risk The term \"interest rate risk\" refers to the potential impact of a change in market interest rates on the present value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and on the result from interest operations in the income statement resulting mainly from maturity mismatches. PostFinance's interest-earning operations are a key earnings driver for Swiss Post. As changes in interest rates have a direct impact on net interest income, management of the risks associated with such changes is considered a pri- ority. The majority of customer deposits held by PostFinance are non-maturing and do not earn a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate of these deposits is therefore estimated using a replication method which aims to map the most closely matching maturities of similar customer products while minimizing interest margin volatility. An additional liquidity buffer is used to cover short-term vol- ume fluctuations. The maturities of money and capital market investments are determined on the basis of the target present value sensitivity of equity capital, and used to define the maturity transformation strategy. The resulting imbalance between the liability and asset interest rates corresponds to the maturity transformation, which is controlled from a present value and income perspective. The present value perspective covers the net effect of a change in interest rates on the equity capital of PostFinance in the event of modifications to the yield curve. Future cash flow accruals are discoun- ted according to the risk-adjusted present value formula. Sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve is de- termined on the one hand, and to isolated interest shocks at specific maturities (key rates) on the other. The present value sensitivity of equity capital is measured by the Risk Management depart- ment on a weekly basis and reported to the Executive Board. If the present value sensitivity deviates significantly from the required level specified by the Executive Board due to short-term shocks, maturity can be controlled on the asset side using swaps. Absolute change in the present value of equity CHF million 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Flattener shock in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2.1 -190 -279 1 In order to determine the present value sensitivity of equity, the six standard shocks in accordance with FINMA Circular 2019/2 \"Interest rate risks - banks\" have been applied since 1.1.2019. The scenario resulting in the greatest negative change in the present value of equity is shown per reference date. Unlike assessments based on present value, income perspective analyses examine the impact of several potential multiple period interest scenarios on PostFinance's future interest income. In addi- tion, dynamic income simulations are carried out for a broad set of deterministic scenarios over the course of the year. These scenarios describe future market interest trends and the resulting changes in customer interest and customer volumes for each replica, as well as different maturity transfor- mation strategies where applicable. Dynamic income simulations are carried out by the Risk Man- agement unit. Risk control proposals are submitted and discussed regularly with the Executive Board on the basis of the results. #### Liquidity risks Liquidity risk refers to the risk that current and future payment obligations cannot be met on time or in full. Liquidity risks are managed with a one-day, a one-month, a three-month and a one-year time horizon. To guarantee liquidity on a daily basis, liquidity figures are defined for the settlement of unforeseen payments. These figures should be available for use in stress situations in particular, when it may no longer be possible to turn to the unsecured interbank market for liquidity. The min- imum amount for the liquidity figures is based on high daily cash outflows with an extremely low probability of occurrence. Determining and limiting the regulatory key figures liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) ensure liquidity over a one-month and one-year horizon. <!-- PageNumber=\"60\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> To ensure liquidity over a three-month horizon, liquidity stress scenarios are defined that must not lead to illiquidity. Long-term stable financing beyond a one-year horizon is ensured by the structur- al liquidity ratio (net stable funding ratio, NSFR). There is an emergency plan to resolve any liquidity crises. ##### Market risks PostFinance does not keep a trading book, and uses the market risk, standardized approach in ac- cordance with art. 86 CAO to determine its minimum capital requirement for market risks. To limit the market risks taken, each year the Board of Directors of PostFinance sets a maximum figure not to be exceeded with regard to regulatory minimum capital to cover market risks. According to PostFinance's business model, market risks are expressed by increased volatility in the income statement in the short term. PostFinance is exposed to market risks for two reasons: \\- Open foreign currency items and changes in value arising from foreign currency derivatives affect the volatility of the income statement (foreign currency risks). \\- Changes in the value of instruments that are recognized according to the principle of the lower of cost or market value or managed in accordance with hedge accounting (including fund investments in the banking book, hedged items and the related hedging instruments) may also have an effect on the volatility of the income statement. Market risks are modelled according to value at risk and limited in the income statement by the Board of Directors. To measure market risks, the risk factors that have an impact on the present val- ue of the relevant item are assigned to each item. The change in present value is modelled according to the change in the allocated risk factors. A functional correlation between the item value and the associated risk factors must also be defined. The stochasticity of all relevant risk factors over the next 250 days is determined on the basis of probability distribution assumptions. Corresponding market data time series are used to calibrate the probability distributions. The distribution of changes to the income statement over a one-year period can be determined with the help of the functional corre- lation established between risk factors and portfolio items. Value at risk is then determined on the basis of the 95 percent quantile. The Risk Management department measures market risks on a weekly basis. It informs the Executive Board of the extent to which limits are used and submits risk control proposals where necessary. As at 31 December 2021, value at risk for the income statement stood at 9 million francs (previous year: 10 million francs). Operational and strategic risks In line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, operational risk at PostFinance is defined as the risk of direct financial loss, reduced revenues, additional internal expenses or a combination thereof, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Strategic risk refers to the risk of failing to achieve company goals at the level of the funda- mental or long-term orientation of the institution as a result of unexpected developments or incor- rect assessment of the relevant economic, regulatory and social environment. The Board of Directors sets out the principles for managing operational and strategic risks and defines the risk appetite in the risk policy regulations. The risk appetite is defined using quantitative and/or qualitative directives and plays an essential role in the management of PostFinance's business activities. Using suitable management instru- ments, the risk management process ensures that the risks assumed are in line with the risk appetite and that the risk capacity and in particular the legal and regulatory requirements can only be in- fringed during stress phases. The stabilization and emergency plan is a set of measures used to iden- tify the options available to PostFinance and enable either the continuation of business activities or, alternatively, an orderly wind-down with the continuation of systemically important functions, even during stressful periods. The risk appetite for operational risks is defined for the relevant sub-categories. Compliance, secu- rity and all other operational risks with the potential to lead to serious infringements of laws or reg- <!-- PageNumber=\"61\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements ulations in plausible, adverse scenarios are not tolerated. In the area of behavioural risks, no activities that are unlawful or unethical or that otherwise jeopardize PostFinance's reputation as a credible, reliable, trustworthy and responsible company are tolerated. The risk appetite for strategic risks is taken into account by the Board of Directors when drawing up the business strategy. The Board of Directors is provided with a periodic assessment of the extent of the strategic risks for this purpose, along with evidence that the strategy is viable in all dimensions and in compliance with the risk appetite as part of the equity capital planning process. ## 4 Capital adequacy disclosure in accordance with FINMA Circular 2016/1 According to the decree issued by the SNB on 29 June 2015, PostFinance was designated a system- ically important financial group. For this reason, PostFinance must comply with the requirements set out in Articles 124-136 of the Ordinance on Capital Adequacy and Risk Diversification for Banks and Securities Dealers (CAO). Two disclosures showing PostFinance's equity situation were published as at 31 December 2021. The information in the \"Capital adequacy disclosure\" meets the requirements of Annexes 1 and 2 of the FINMA Circular 2016/1 \"Disclosure - banks\". The capital adequacy disclosure on grounds of systemic importance, which is a parallel calculation in accordance with Annex 3 of the aforemen- tioned Circular, is also published. The different requirements result in deviations, particularly with regard to eligible capital and capital ratios. The specified documents are published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. ## 5 Disclosure of climate-related financial risks Banks and insurance companies are required to inform the public adequately about their risks. These also include the consequences of climate change, which could pose significant financial risks for fi- nancial institutions in the longer term. FINMA is requiring large banks and insurance companies to provide qualitative and quantitative information in this area and amended its circulars on disclosure in 2021. PostFinance is publishing the climate-related financial risks for the first time for 2021 with a separate disclosure. The specified document is published at -> postfinance.ch/reporting. This report, drawn up in accordance with the internationally recognized TCFD initiative, provides transparency by supervised entities about their climate-related financial risks, and is a first important step towards identifying, measuring and managing these risks. FINMA also clarified its supervisory practice in the area of disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In doing so it is fulfilling its strate- gic goal of contributing to the sustainable development of the Swiss financial center. Besides the consideration of climate risks in supervisory activities and preventing the public from being misled about a product's sustainable characteristics (greenwashing), promoting transparency is FINMA's major focus in this realm. <!-- PageNumber=\"62\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> ",

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle.

The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year. Reclassifications within the three levels were immaterial in nature. <!-- PageNumber=\"74\" --> <!-- PageHeader=\"PostFinance Ltd Annual Report 2021\" --> 18 | Bank's capital\n=== PostFinance Ltd is owned entirely by Swiss Post Ltd.

Their pension benefits are handled exclusively by the Swiss Post pension fund. The employer may be required to pay restructuring con- tributions in the event of underfunding of the Swiss Post pension fund. Additional amounts due for extended disability benefit plans in the form of transitional invalidity insurance (supplementary disability pensions for men up to the age of 65 and women up to the age of 64) are taken into account in the annual financial statements. Staff vouchers were paid out to pension beneficiaries for the last time in 2021 and the scheme was discontinued. <!-- PageNumber=\"71\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report \\- Statutory annual financial statements Liabilities relating to own pension schemes as per Swiss GAAP ARR 16 All the compulsory ordinary employer contributions associated with the pension plan are accounted for as personnel expenses using the accrual-based accounting principle. An annual assessment is carried out in accordance with Swiss GAAP ARR 16 to determine whether, for PostFinance, the pen- sion schemes generate an economic benefit or an economic obligation. The assessment is based on information from contracts, the annual financial statements of the pension schemes and other cal- culations presenting their financial situation and current overfunding or underfunding - in accord- ance with Swiss GAAP ARR 26 accounting principles. PostFinance does not, however, intend to use the economic benefit that may result from overfunding to reduce employer contributions. Conse- quently, a future economic benefit is not capitalized. An economic obligation is, however, recognized under liabilities. With 39,313 active insured persons and 29,399 pensioners (as at 31 October 2021), the Swiss Post pension fund had total assets of 17,674 million francs as at 31 December 2021 (pre- vious year: 17,086 million francs). The level of cover calculated according to the accounting principles applicable to the Swiss Post pension fund stands at approximately 109.6 percent (previous year: 105.3 percent). As the Swiss Post pension fund value fluctuation reserves have not yet reached the set regulatory level, there is no overfunding available. The Swiss Post pension fund has employer contribution reserves of 350 million francs without a waiver of use (previous year: 551 million francs without a waiver of use). A technical interest rate of 1.5 percent (previous year: 1.75 percent) and the technical basis of OPA 2020 (previous year: OPA 2015) were used to calculate pension cover. It should be noted that all data regarding the Swiss Post pension fund is based on the information available at the time of drawing up the ARR 16 financial statements. Consequently, it may differ from the actual information contained in the annual financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund. A detailed assessment did not reveal any financial impact on the bank; according to the financial statements for the Swiss Post pension fund drawn up according to Swiss GAAP ARR 26, there were no spare funds or underfunding as at 31 December 2021. There are no employer-sponsored pension schemes. The economic benefit or economic obligations and pension expenses can be summarized as follows: Presentation of the eco- nomic benefit/obligation and the pension expenses Overfunding/ underfunding Economic interest of PostFinance Ltd Change in economic interest (eco- nomic benefit/ obligation) versus previous year Contributions paid Pension expenses in personnel expenses CHF million 31.12.2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 2021 2021 31.12.2020 31.12.2021 Swiss Post pension fund 150 0 0 0 37 36 37 Staff vouchers \u2013 -7 \u2013 -7 0 0 -7 Disability pensions -1 -2 -1 -1 0 1 - 1 Total ARR 16 149 -9 - 1 -8 37 37 29 The employer contribution reserves of the Swiss Post pension fund are allocated based on the per- centage of PostFinance's retirement capital of the entire retirement capital.

The assessment of the effects remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty. However, the economic situation has improved slightly since March 2021 and the outlook is brighter. The effects on the holdings of expected losses on financial investments and receivables were taken into account by updating the model parame- ters, which led to a reduction in value adjustments required of 6 million francs in the current finan- cial year.

Box www.ey.com/ch CH-3001 Berne To the General Meeting of PostFinance Ltd, Berne Berne, 25 February 2022 ## Report of the statutory auditor on the financial statements As statutory auditor, we have audited the financial statements of PostFinance Ltd, which comprise the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes (pages 41 to 81), including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the year ended 31 December 2021. ### Board of Directors' responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework for banks, the requirements of Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. #### Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements, which provide a true and fair view of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows, are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. :selected: ## Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 give a true and fair view of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework for banks and comply with Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation. <!-- PageNumber=\"83\" --> Foreword Interview Corporate governance Management report - Statutory annual financial statements <!-- FigureContent=\"EY\" -->\nBuilding a better working world <!-- PageNumber=\"2\" --> Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.
