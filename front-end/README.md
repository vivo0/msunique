# AI-Powered Financial Analysis Dashboard

This project is a prototype of an AI-enhanced financial analysis dashboard, developed as part of a hackathon exploring the application of AI in finance.

## Overview

This frontend application provides a user interface for interacting with AI-powered financial analysis tools. It's built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, leveraging various libraries to create an interactive and responsive dashboard.

**Note:** This project is a proof-of-concept developed by a single person within the constraints of a hackathon. As such, the UI is not complete and lacks many features and functionalities that would be present in a full production version. It may contain bugs and has not undergone extensive testing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build and start the application using Docker:
   `docker-compose build`
   `docker-compose up`
   (For detailed instructions on using Docker, please refer to the backend README)

4. Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your configuration)
